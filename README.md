# CMC Games

These are the scripts powering the dynamic game list for the ["Codename: Modern Combat" project](http://ccf.striver.net/pr.php?pr=888), using the [Sulphur library](https://github.com/beheh/sulphur/) for parsing the [Masterserver](http://league.clonkspot.org:80) announcements.

[Clonk](http://clonk.de/) is moddable two-dimensional game, with Clonk Rage being the most popular title. The Clonk Forge is an open site for players and developers to present their projects.

Codename: Modern Combat (CMC) is a massive total conversion mod for Clonk Rage.
